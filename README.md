# Odin Project #7: Admin Dashboard

Welcome to Bryan Miller's Library Project, the [eighth assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) within the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this repo is to practice the following skill sets:

- JavaScript
  - Object & Object Constructor Design Pattern
  - Prototypes & Prototypal Inheritance
    - Prototype: _a property that all functions have that points to an object_
    - Inheritance: _inheriting the prototype of another object_
  - `Object.create`
    - _Creates an object and sets its prototype equal to another object_
- HTML / CSS
